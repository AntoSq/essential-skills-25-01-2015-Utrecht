## Open Refine (Data cleaning with OpenRefine)
To install OpenRefine please follow instructions in [OpenRefine Documentation](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions)
 
## Python 
For Python lessons we will be using Anaconda distribution. You can download
installer for your platform from [Continuum Analitics page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
Please download **PYTHON 3.5** version.
After downloading follow [Installation instructions](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install).

Installer should put `Launcher` file somewhere available. Use this `Launcher` to start anaconda applications,
like Python Console or IPython Notebook. 
 
## SQLite
SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases. We use a simple
database manager called [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) in our lessons.
We will use [SQLite Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/)
plugin for [Firefox](http://www.datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology/). If you don't have Firefox installed, you need to instal it first and then you will be able to add the plugin. 
 
## Shell and Git
 
  * Windows

    * Bash & Git
    
     Install Git for Windows by downloading and running
     [the installer](http://msysgit.github.io/).
     This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.

    * Editor
    
     We suggest to use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
    
  * Mac OS X

    * Bash
    
      The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no need to
      install anything. You access bash from the Terminal (found in
      `/Applications/Utilities`). You may want to keep Terminal in your dock
      for this workshop.
      
    * Editor
    
      We recommend [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)
      or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).
      In a pinch, you can use `nano`, which should be pre-installed.
      
    * Git
    
      For OS X 10.8 and higher, install Git for Mac by downloading and running
      [the installer](http://git-scm.com/downloads). For older versions of OS X
      (10.5-10.7) use the most recent available installer for your OS
      [available here](https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list).
      Use the Leopard installer for 10.5 and the Snow Leopard installer for 10.6-10.7.

  * Linux

    * Bash
      
      The default shell is usually `bash`, but if your machine is set up differently
      you can run it by opening a terminal and typing `bash`. There is no need to
      install anything.
    
    * Editor

      [Kate](http://kate-editor.org/) is one option for Linux users. In a pinch,
      you can use `nano`, which should be pre-installed.

    * Git
    
      If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to install it via
      your distro's package manager (e.g. `apt-get` or `yum`).
      
During git lesson, we will be also learning some features of [Github](https://github.com) - collaboration,
code review, and code management site. You need to register at github
[here](https://github.com/join).
